# step
The first step to automate things; from a Markdown into a CLI

## The rationale behind this

There are so many manual tasks out there, most of them made of innumerous steps.
Whenever someone thinks about automating them or even proposing this to their team,
it sounds like a Herculean task.

What if we turn a checklist into a CLI and turn a gigantic process into something
more feasible?

## Development

First, you're going to need Python 3.10+. Then, [poetry]() installed.
